	<h4>Hello World!</h4>
	<p>
		Hello World,

		this is my first website and my first homework assignment. I am currently enrolled at Northwestern for their bootcamp, this is my second week at Northwestern Coding Bootcamp, located in Downtown Chicago. Right now I am learning html and css,these are the two languages that I used to program this website.
	</p>

	<p>
		As time moves on, I know I will learn alot about becoming a web developer, for example how to connect my contact page to my email account, but for now, this must do. Therefore please to do try to contact me by email because the link doesn't work.
		Good Bye World,
		FOR NOW...
	</p>
	<p>The following is dummy text cause I wanted to fill up the page. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
